He even managed to escape from prison, twice. In the end El Chapo was arrested, extradited to the US, and tried in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-placeholder=\"Terjemahan\" dir=\"ltr\">Now El Chapo&#39;s son is being hunted. El Chapo&#39;s son, Ovidio Guzm&aacute;n Lopez, brought shame to his own government this week, when cartel accomplices forced a patrol of 30 members of government forces to release him after he was arrested, New York Times reports, Oct. 19, 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-placeholder=\"Terjemahan\" dir=\"ltr\">A number of members of the Mexican squad who raided Ovidio are taken hostage by criminals and forced to release El Chapo&#39;s son.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-placeholder=\"Terjemahan\" dir=\"ltr\">---</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-placeholder=\"Terjemahan\" dir=\"ltr\">The gun battle began with a siege in the city of Culiacan on Thursday by members of the Sinaloa Cartel, once led by El Chapo. Videos of fierce street fighting, gunmen blocking roads, residents fleeing to safety and black smoke rising from burning vehicles flooded social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-placeholder=\"Terjemahan\" dir=\"ltr\">Reports state that after Ovido&#39;s arrest, his cartel carried out a fierce offensive to free him and prevent his extradition to the United States. But the government has remained silent, asking residents to stay indoors and avoid the streets throughout the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-placeholder=\"Terjemahan\" dir=\"ltr\">Later the government said patrols had found Guzm&aacute;n, but had suspended operations when the authorities were outnumbered by cartel members. The next morning on Friday, the government admitted that the patrol was actually an operation planned to capture Guzm&aacute;n and extradite him to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-placeholder=\"Terjemahan\" dir=\"ltr\">The armed forces managed to detain him, but they were forced to release him after eight members of the patrol were kidnapped and held hostage, the government said. Surrounded by enemies, with no clear contingency plan on the ground or in the air, and no clear evacuation strategy, the soldiers relented and returned Guzm&aacute;n junior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-placeholder=\"Terjemahan\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;The decision was made I support and I agree with because the situation has become very bad and many people are threatened. Finally a decision was made to protect people&#39;s lives,&quot; said President Andr&eacute;s Manuel L&oacute;pez Obrador.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.tmpo.co/data/2019/10/19/id_881895/881895_720.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 281px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p data-placeholder=\"Terjemahan\" dir=\"ltr\">However, several people linked to the cartel were detained and injured, Sinaloa Security Secretary Cristobal Castaneda said, quoted from RT.com. He added that the local government was working with the National Guard, Army and Navy on the operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-placeholder=\"Terjemahan\" dir=\"ltr\">According to a former American official and others briefed on the matter, the force behind the cartel&#39;s swift and effective response is El Chapo&#39;s eldest son, Ivan, who has taken on a prominent role in the cartel since his father was arrested, extradited to the United States and sentenced. jailed for life in July on drug, murder and money laundering charges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-placeholder=\"Terjemahan\" dir=\"ltr\">They say that Ivan was initially captured by the military as well, but his henchmen quickly overpowered the armed forces and secured his release. After being released, Ivan then arranges a plan to free his brother, Ovidio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-placeholder=\"Terjemahan\" dir=\"ltr\">The efforts include not only holding soldiers hostage, but also kidnapping their families, according to sources familiar with the matter. There has been no comment from the government regarding this report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-placeholder=\"Terjemahan\" dir=\"ltr\">The events in Culiacan come after a week that began with the killing of 13 state police officers by another cartel in Michoacan and a shootout outside Iguala in Guerrero that left 15 people dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-placeholder=\"Terjemahan\" dir=\"ltr\">Guzm&aacute;n&#39;s father, El Chapo, was arrested several times before being sentenced to life in prison in the United States. The leaders of other drug cartels, namely the Zeta Cartel, the Gulf Cartel and other cartels have been arrested in coordinated action between law enforcement and the Mexican armed forces.</p>\r\n', 'kartel.jpg', 3, '2021-11-07 11:49:02', '2021-02-15 08:02:02', 1),

Alfred Jodl, representing the German High Command, signed a document unconditionally surrendering all German military forces, to take effect the following day, thereby all but ending World War II in Europe. The signing ceremony took place at Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) at Reims, in northwestern France.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Although at the time of the surrender virtually all of Germany was under Allied control, German forces still occupied western Netherlands, Denmark, much of Norway, as well as western and central Czechoslovakia. German and Russian troops fought on in the East for most of the next day.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Initially, following instructions from Grand Adm. Karl Donitz, Hitler&rsquo;s successor, Jodl offered to surrender all forces fighting the Western Allies. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, threatened to break off negotiations unless the Germans agreed to a complete unconditional surrender to all the Allies on all fronts.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Eisenhower told Jodl that he would order western lines closed to German soldiers, thus forcing them to surrender to the advancing Soviets on the Eastern Front. Jodl sent a radio signal to Donitz in Flensburg, a remaining enclave on the Danish border, informing him of Eisenhower&#39;s ultimatum. Shortly after midnight, Donitz sent a signal to Jodl authorizing the complete and total surrender of all German forces.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CEbMNNoWEAAMu_c.jpg\" style=\"width: 480px; height: 320px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, Eisenhower&rsquo;s chief of staff, signed for SHAEF while French Gen. Francois Sevez and Soviet Major Gen. Ivan Susloparov signed as witnesses. The Kremlin called for a second four-power surrender ceremony, which took place May 8 in a former German Army engineering school in the Berlin district of Karlshorst. (It now houses the German-Russian Museum Berlin-Karlshorst.) May 8 was declared Victory-in-Europe (V-E) Day, a day still celebrated as a public holiday in some European countries, including Russia.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Though not one of the conspirators, Jodl had been injured in the assassination attempt on Hitler in 1944. An Allied tribunal sitting in Nuremberg found him guilty of war crimes. He was hanged on Oct. 16, 1946. In 1953, a German appeals court found Jodl not guilty and granted him a posthumous pardon.</p>\n\n<p>President Harry S. Truman proclaimed a formal cessation of hostilities between the United States and Germany on Dec. 13, 1946. A conference in Paris, held in February 1947, ended with the signing of peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Finland, countries that at various times during the war had aligned themselves with Nazi Germany as the Axis Powers.</p>\n\n<p>The Allied military occupation of West German territory formally ended on May 5, 1955, with the recognition of the Federal Republic of Germany as having &ldquo;the full authority of a sovereign state.&rdquo; That treaty ended the military occupation of West German territory, although the three Western occupying powers &mdash; the United States, Great Britain, and France &mdash; retained their military rights in West Berlin until 1994.</p>\n\n<p><i>SOURCE: WWW.HISTORY.COM</i></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><i>taken from&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/07/nazi-germany-surrenders-may-7-1945-568948\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/07/nazi-germany-surrenders-may-7-1945-568948</a></strong></i></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n', 'EXZf6Q4XQAE7uED.jpeg', 3, '2021-11-05 17:41:50', '2021-11-04 13:55:12', 1),

On the other hand, the news is a reminder that Japan raped, tortured and murdered tens of millions of people in what&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.vancouversun.com/news/douglas+todd+lest+overlook+asian+holocaust/11746977/story.html\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">become known</a>&nbsp;as &ldquo;the Asian Holocaust&rdquo; &mdash; something that textbooks in Western countries barely even mention at all.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Below is an overview of the litany of atrocities Japan committed during the Second Sino-Japanese War, which was a kind of parallel conflict alongside World War II.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<section>\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"0bdd\">all began in 1931 when Japan, seeking to increase the size of its empire and exploit China&rsquo;s vast natural resources, invaded and occupied the province of Manchuria.</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"bf0e\">Six years later, judging its occupation a success, Japan mounted a full-scale invasion of China, a move that sparked a full blown war that would leave&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nationalww2museum.org/learn/education/for-students/ww2-history/ww2-by-the-numbers/world-wide-deaths.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">20 million Chinese people</a>&nbsp;dead. (Some estimates have put the figure as high as 50 million, but humanity will likely never know the exact extent of Japan&rsquo;s barbarity.)</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"e362\">During the war, Japan also invaded a number of other parts of Asia, including Malaya, Burma, Indochina, the Philippines and the Dutch West Indies. In those invasions, the Japanese killed an additional 8.6 million people.</p>\n\n<h1 data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"21b5\">&lsquo;Comfort women&rsquo; (read: forced prostitution)</h1>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"396e\">Japan&rsquo;s military applied the euphemism &ldquo;comfort women&rdquo; to describe women of conquered countries who were forced into sexual slavery and raped by Japanese soldiers. Historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi found incontrovertible evidence that the Japanese built about 2,000 &ldquo;comfort stations&rdquo; around Asia where Japanese soldiers could rape native women. These 2,000 rape centers held as many as 200,000 women from Korea, the Philippines and other countries.</p>\n\n<h1 data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"8e2e\"><strong>Mass rape and murder</strong></h1>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"422e\">After the Japanese captured the Chinese city of Nanjing in December 1937, they perpetrated one of the worst massacres of the 20th century (and there&rsquo;s some stiff competition for that).</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"a81a\">In Nanjing, Japanese troops &ldquo;let loose like the hordes of Genghis Khan,&rdquo; writes British historian Edward Russell. Soldiers rampaged the streets, murdering anyone they saw. Russell found burial statistics indicating more than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=8NiLDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=japanese+war+crimes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRmqSfsI3QAhUH4GMKHf-SCPcQ6AEIPTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=japanese%20war%20crimes&amp;f=false\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">150,000</a>&nbsp;people were buried in mass graves, most with their hands tied behind their backs. He estimated 200,000 had died; later estimates range to more than 300,000 in a period of just 6 weeks.</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"a2ee\">The violence appalled even Nazi Germany, still a few years away from committing its own holocaust. The German embassy in China wrote to Berlin that the &ldquo;atrocities and criminal acts of an entire army&rdquo; amounted to &ldquo;bestial machinery.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"1147\">By one estimate, 20,000 women were raped. &ldquo;So that we will not have any problems on our hands,&rdquo; one company commander told his men, &ldquo;either pay them money or kill them in some obscure place after you have finished.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"ffb9\">As Japan met resistance in conquering China, the Nanjing blueprint was applied to the whole country. Surveying the aftermath of the war in 1945, researcher Gavan McCormack described a landscape of torched villages, &ldquo;people-reducing kilns&rdquo; (which the Japanese called&nbsp;<em>renjiro)</em>&nbsp;and mass graves, or &ldquo;ten thousand people pits&rdquo; (<em>bajinkō</em>).</p>\n\n<h1 data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"d7ba\">Mistreatment of POWs</h1>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"5d7e\">Japanese military leaders who were later defendants at the War Crimes Tribunals argued that Japan had not been bound by the 1929 Geneva Convention, which it had signed but never ratified. But Japan was bound by Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, which stated that POWs remained &ldquo;under the protection and principles of the laws of nations as they resulted from the usages of civilized peoples, the laws of humanity, and the dictate of public conscience.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"1417\">Japan forced POWs to endure 130-mile death marches and forced labor on war-related projects. They were denied adequate food, water and medical care. They were beheaded, or used as targets for rifle and machine gun practice.</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"16bc\">Japan treated its POWs even worse than the Nazis: After the war, tribunals found that Japan had interned some 350,000 prisoners of war. An estimated 27% of Allied POWs died in captivity, compared to a mere 4% of POWs who died in German and Italian captivity.</p>\n\n<h1 data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"d124\">Cannibalism</h1>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"aabd\">Witnesses and official documents confirm many cases of Japanese soldiers eating the corpses of prisoners and enemies they&rsquo;d killed in battle. Records show that Japanese soldiers ate Australian soldiers and local civilians in New Guinea. A downed American pilot watched as the same fate befall a fellow airman. Witnesses said the Japanese soldiers sometimes washed down the meat with sake. In recounting evidence of cannibalism, historian Toshiyuki Tanaka wrote that it was not engaged in because supplies were scarce, as the Allies had concluded, but was used as a<a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Japanese-ate-Indian-PoWs-used-them-as-live-targets-in-WWII/articleshow/40017577.cms\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;power projection tool</a>.</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"1b6e\">The Japanese would kill prisoners and then &ldquo;eat the flesh&rdquo; from their bodies, according to one Indian Army officer. &ldquo;The liver, muscles from the buttocks, thighs, legs, and arms would be cut off and cooked,&rdquo; the officer, Captain Pirzai,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Japanese-ate-Indian-PoWs-used-them-as-live-targets-in-WWII/articleshow/40017577.cms\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">told Australia&rsquo;s Courier-Mail</a>&nbsp;in 1945.</p>\n\n<h1 data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"8324\">Medical and biological warfare</h1>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"1dbf\">In a macabre practice that would later be committed by Nazi doctors, Japanese Army Unit 731 conducted experiments on thousands of Chinese and Russian prisoners of war. They exposed subjects to cholera, plague, hemorrhagic fever, typhoid and syphilis. They removed their organs and drilled holes in their heads. Prisoners were sprayed with salt water to induce frostbite in subzero temperatures and then hit with hammers &mdash; all in the name of science.</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"4933\">&ldquo;No matter what was done, anything was permissible so long as it was &ldquo;for the country&rdquo; or for the &ldquo;good of society,&rdquo; write Japanese historians Tsuneishi Keiichi and Tomizo Asano in their 1982 book, &ldquo;Suicide of Two Physicians.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"84fa\">Werner Gruhl, author of &ldquo;Imperial Japan&rsquo;s World War Two,&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.japanww2.com/wc05.htm\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a>&nbsp;the Japanese killed 250,000 Chinese by biological experimentation and biological warfare.</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1 data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"d8df\">The legacy of Japan&rsquo;s wartime atrocities</h1>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"0e68\">Japan&rsquo;s holocaust ended when the US dropped two atomic bombs on the country in August, 1945.

Japan surrendered unconditionally 9 days later.</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*8a--3I7P5YjVgek2.\" style=\"width: 880px; height: 627px;\" /></p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"c4eb\">Only 28 Japanese military and government officials were tried at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in 1946. (The tribunal was overseen by the US.) Three died during trial. The other 25 were found guilty. Of those, 7 were hanged and 18 were sentenced to prison terms, but were pardoned by 1958. Scandalously, in 1959, Japan&rsquo;s Emperor Hirohito ordered the names of the war criminals added to a shrine in Tokyo where Japanese have traditionally memorialized their fallen fighters.</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"768f\">&ldquo;I have a special appreciation for the families of our war criminals,&rdquo; Hirohito said in a benediction. &ldquo;I know what they have done for Japan. They were among our greatest leaders.&rdquo; Subsequent Japanese leaders have visited the shrine but claim they are not honoring war criminals, just fulfilling their obligations to the dead.</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"73dd\">China vigorously opposes presidential visits to the Yasukuni shrine, and has been demanding an apology for the Rape of Nanjing and other atrocities &mdash; but only for the last few decades. Before that,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://globalriskinsights.com/2016/10/how-nanjing-became-a-political-tool/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">according to</a>&nbsp;GRI Senior Analyst Jeremy Luedi, China&rsquo;s Maoist leaders hadn&rsquo;t drawn attention to the Rape of Nanjing because they wanted to showcase events that portrayed Chinese as fighters, not victims, and also because the victims in Nanjing were not the Communists, who took over China after the war, but their rivals &mdash; the Nationalists.</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"5b15\">Former &ldquo;comfort women&rdquo; have also demanded a full apology from Japan for decades. In a compromise for Japan&rsquo;s nationalist prime minister Shinzo Abe, Japan&rsquo;s government agreed in December to pay a combined $8.3 million to the women (or their next of kin). The deal was immediately criticized by South Korean opposition parties and former comfort women, who have demanded a deal that opens Japan up to legal liability.</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" id=\"bafe\">Many Japanese are unaware of their nation&rsquo;s war crimes, as are young people in the countries that were prey to Japan&rsquo;s brutal imperialism. The comfort women represent the last human faces of Japan&rsquo;s wartime atrocities, and they are either elderly or dead. It is up to historians &mdash; and all of us &mdash; to ensure that the memory of Japan&rsquo;s atrocities does not die with them.</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">taken from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/dose/the-asian-holocaust-killed-twice-as-many-people-as-the-nazis-did-877f0a7c664\"><strong>https://medium.com/dose/the-asian-holocaust-killed-twice-as-many-people-as-the-nazis-did-877f0a7c664</strong></a></p>\n\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">&nbsp;</p>\n</section>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n', '1_sr_KnzcWI2FCMM5biqCzVA.jpeg', 3, '2021-11-05 17:41:04', '2021-11-04 14:07:44', 1),

After 32 years in charge, President Suharto announced his resignation.</p>\n\n<p>Before resigning, many actions and events prompted Suharto to resign. On May 12, the Trisakti Tragedy killed four students in a demonstration.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Then, there was the action on May 18, 1998, in which a mob of students managed to control the mpr / dpr building complex. The barrage of pressure forced the neck of Suharto&#39;s rule.</p>\n\n<p>Suharto meets scholars and community leaders</p>\n\n<p>On May 19, 1998, Suharto met with scholars and community leaders, including Chairman of PB Nahdlatul Ulama Abdurrahman Wahid, Emha Ainun Nadjib, Director of Paramadina Nucholish Madjid Foundation, and Chairman of the Indonesian Ulema Council Ali Yafie, Prof Malik Fadjar (Muhammadiyah).</p>\n\n<p>At the meeting Suharto stated that he would reshuffle the Seventh Development Cabinet and change its name to the Reform Cabinet. Nurcholish stated the idea of a cabinet reshuffle and forming a Reform Committee was purely from Suharto, not their proposal.</p>\n\n<p>Although Suharto had given various ideas, there were already signs that he would resign. However, there were two people who disagreed with Suharto&#39;s resignation. This is considered not to solve the problem.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://voi.id/storage/publishers/53177/body_image_2021052115.jpeg\" style=\"width: 942px; height: 567px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But on the other hand, not a few parties also explicitly asked Suharto to step down. One of them is a statement from the Chairman of the House of Representatives / MPR Harmoko after the Meeting of Leaders of the House of Representatives on May 18, 1998.</p>\n\n<p>Quoting Kompas, Friday, May 21, Harmoko stated that for the sake of national unity and unity, the leaders of the House of Representatives, both the Chairman and the vice chairmen, expected Suharto to resign from the presidency wisely and wisely.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In his speech, Suharto stated: I have stated the plan to establish a Reform Committee and change the composition of the 7th Development Cabinet, but the fact to this day shows that the Reform Committee could not be realized, due to the lack of adequate response to the plan to establish the committee.</p>\n\n<p>The straining of Suharto and Habibie&#39;s relationship</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://voi.id/storage/publishers/53177/body_image_2021052115-2.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 461px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Didn&#39;t wait long. The Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia at the time, BJ Habibie, was immediately sworn in as president.</p>\n\n<p>After taking the oath of office, Habibie and Suharto shook hands without saying a word. The atmosphere was tense between the two until Suharto left the room.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Unexpectedly. The meeting was the last between the two.&nbsp;Quoting Historia, Habibie spoke by phone on June 9, 1998, the day after Suharto&#39;s birthday.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to congratulating him, Habibie also asked Suharto to meet. But Suharto refused.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It is not favorable for the current situation, if I meet with Habibie. Do your job well, I can only do the job until here. I am old,&quot; suharto said.</p>\n\n<p>Since then Suharto never wanted to see Habibie. In his writing in Decisive Seconds, Habibie said that until his presidential duties ended, he never managed to meet with Suharto, although Habibie worked many ways.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I believe Mr. Harto has his own reasons, and may think I should not know. I sincerely if that&#39;s the will of Mr. Harto ... And the history of the sale later that will reveal the puzzle of this mysteriousness,&quot; said Habibie.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>taken from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://voi.id/en/memori/53177/soeharto-resigns-after-32-years-as-president-of-indonesia-in-history-today-may-21-1998\"><strong>https://voi.id/en/memori/53177/soeharto-resigns-after-32-years-as-president-of-indonesia-in-history-today-may-21-1998</strong></a></p>\n', '202105211535-main.cropped_1621586148.jpg', 3, '2021-11-05 17:40:13', '2021-11-04 14:17:09', 1),
